# Social Media Marketing Automation

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs live as GitHub Issues (via the `gh` CLI); external PRs are not a triage surface. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default vocabulary (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### Verifying a change

Launching the app and driving it end-to-end (infra, API, SPA, provisioning a
Client, clicking the OAuth connect flows against the fake Publisher). See
`.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md`.
